# Intro to Legend

Legend is a flexible platform that offers solutions to explore, define, connect, and integrate data into your business processes. Getting access to accurate and complete data has become increasingly difficult for a few reasons:

- The amount, speed, and complexity of information is exploding exponentially.
- Businesses often operate within data silos, limiting opportunities to collaborate, connect, and communicate efficiently.
- Data inventories aren't well understood due to a lack of meaningful metrics, like usage and information flow.

The Legend platform provides solutions to these challenges.

## Feature sets

Learn about the different independent feature sets and how they add value to your data-driven organization.

- **Studio**: Describe and connect data in business terms to create data models. Standardize terms and relationships across the entire organization to foster consistent data vocabulary. Express those data models in diagrams to facilitate the dialog between business and development teams.
- **Cube**: Explore data from various data stores through Excel-like operations.
- **Query and Services**: Integrate data in a self-serve manner by first browsing and navigating the data model and then by asking informed questions to the data in Query. Power users can register data-driven services (APIs) with a click of a button in Services allowing the repeated and controlled usage of the queries. It's easy to build customized user interfaces with those APIs, increasing both developer productivity and time to market of your data products.

The Legend platform is backed by an execution engine that supplies powerful insights and a Change Management (SDLC) process that provides detailed operational metrics. You can use these data models in your live business flows.

## Phases

The open sourcing of the Legend platform is happening in three phases:

- **Phase 0 (Dec 2019)**: Deploy an external instance of Legend to AWS servers and announce the intention to open source at the FINOS strategy forum.
- **Phase 1 (Jan 2020)**: Make Studio available to a group of bank pilot users collaborating on a derivatives model. In this release, Studio supports a limited set functionality, including the creation of data models, model-to-model mappings, constraints, and derivations. Features that aren't yet available include model-to-database mappings and the execution of queries as services.
- **Phase 2 (Sep 2020)**: Open source Studio along with the language and its execution and SDLC servers.
- **Phase 3 (Dec 2020)**: Open source the remaining toolsâ€”Cube, and Query and Services. This opens up the opportunity to collaborate on even more use cases and the creation of a shared model inventory.
