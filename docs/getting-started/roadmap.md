# Roadmap

## Legend Pilot Phase 0 (October 2019 - January 2020) - *Completed*

### Phase 0 Goals

- Stand-up and deploy an external instance of Legend for shared modeling - *DONE*
- [Open Source Strategy Forum announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPUYUt9Yr_I) of Goldman Sachs' intention to open source Legend and the associated roadmap for that work - *DONE*
- Commence internal code evaluation and preparation for open sourcing - *DONE*

## Legend Pilot Phase 1 (January to September 2020) - *In progress*

### Phase 1 Goals

- **Goal 1:** Evaluate shared modeling using Legend and and define collaboration model for further model development
  - Evaluate how shared modeling can work using Legend and define the best process to work together, by assessing:
    - Governance process
    - Collaboration amongst banks
    - Technical solution
  - Success Criteria
    - Basic fluency in Legend by non-GS modelers using Legend
    - Functional areas of interest identified and working groups to model in those areas commenced
    - Feedback on Legend shared with Goldman development team such that said feedback can be incorporated, as feasible, into the version of Legend released as open source at the start of Phase 2

- **Goal 2:** Using Legend collectively develop a model or model extension
  - Find a good use case, with propensity for value creation through shared modeling and data shaping, and then work on (i.e., model) something “production relevant”
    - Ideally shared models can and should also be contributed back to respective standards bodies such as ISDA for derivatives (e.g., proposed changes to the CDM)
    - FINOS members and community can provide further momentum by implementing models and supporting standards by convention
    - Stretch goal to submit changes back to respective standards body (ISDA) and, better still, see it accepted into the standard
  - Success Criteria
    - Support of standards body (ISDA)

- **Goal 3:** Prepare Legend code base, build system, and stakeholders for open sourcing of code

### Phase 1 Plan - Overall

#### Launch Pilot Group

- Pilot Kick-off (January 29) - *Completed*

#### Modeling

- Import and ready ISDA CDM in Legend - *Completed*
- Define, organize, and launch modeling working groups
  - FX Option - *Launched*
  - Commodities Reference Data - *Launched*
  - Sustainability / Renewable energy Working Group - *Proposed*
- Define potential areas of further modeling collaboration after pilot ends
  - Consider relationship with other FINOS projects like Financial Objects
  - Additional standards and/or standards bodies to collaborate with

## FX Option Working Group Plan

### Stage 1 (4/2 - 5/28/2020)

**Milestone:** One CDM FxOption model change - Outcome *[TBC]*

- Products: Fx Vanilla Option, Fx Barrier Option
- Review FpML FxOption model against CDM and identify relevant vs unused attributes; for relevant attributes review the cardinality and data types
- Submit and test changes to model in Legend Studio
- Add agreed changes to CDM Rosetta for testing and consideration by the CDM Design WG

### Stage 2 (6/4 - 6/25/2020)

**Milestone:** One CDM FX lifecycle model change - Outcome *[TBC]*

- Analyze the business events and primitive processes for 'Exercise', 'Expire' and any other applicable lifecycle events for Fx Vanilla Option
- Suggest and review new attributes for the model, considering validations/conditions are in line with CDM principles
- Submit and test changes to model in Legend Studio
- Add agreed changes to CDM Rosetta for testing and consideration by the CDM Design WG

### Stage 3 (7/2 - 8/6/2020)

**Milestone:** [TBC] - Outcome *[TBC]*

- Analyze other use cases e.g. Fx Strategies, Asian features, exotics scenarios etc 
- Suggest and review new attributes for the model, considering validations/conditions are in line with CDM principles
- Submit and test changes to model in Legend Studio

## Commodities Reference Data Working Group Plan

### Stage 1 (4/8 - 5/27/2020)

**Milestone:** Commodities Reference Data model proposal merge into Legend / Outcome: *Complete*

**Milestone:** CDM Payout change to support Commodities vanilla scenario / Outcome: *[TBC]*

- Product: WTI Fixed/Float Oil Swap.
- Review FpML and identify relevant v unused attributes; for relevant attributes review the cardinality and data types.
- Determine contractual data points v reference data points and how these two models should interact.
- Identify gaps in existing CDM model and make updates to cover the commodities fixed v float scenario.

### Stage 2 (6/3 - 6/25/2020)

**Milestone:** Extend Commodities Reference Data model properties to capture relevant data that can be associated with a product / Outcome *[TBC]*

**Milestone:** Capture extended Commodities use cases in the CDM model in Legend / Outcome: *[TBC]*

- Agree on Reference Data model structure.
- Identify associated data that is required in the industry associated with a product.
- Review additional Commodities payout scenarios and look to factor into the CDM model in Legend.
- Agree on best way to represent Commodities payout in CDM, either as a distinct class, or combined with another existing payout.

### Stage 3 (7/1 – 8/5/2020)

**Milestone #1:** Finalise Reference Data Model construct and agree on next industry steps post pilot phase / Outcome: *[TBC]*

**Milestone #2:** CDM Payout change to support Commodities vanilla scenario / Outcome: *[TBC]*

- Review options and agree on next steps for Reference Data model.
- Finalise Commodities Payout features and merge into Legend.
- Review required qualifier functions for CDM and agree solution for Commodities.
- Add agreed changes to CDM Rosetta for testing and consideration by the CDM Design WG.
